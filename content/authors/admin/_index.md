Hello! My name is <strong>Robyn Wright</strong>, and I am currently a <strong>postdoctoral research fellow in the Langille Lab</strong> (Department of Pharmacology, Dalhousie University) where I am investigating the human microbiome in healthy and diseased individuals. I recently completed an Association of Commonwealth Universities <strong>Blue Charter Fellowship</strong> (October 2019-April 2020; School for Resources and Environmental Studies, Dalhousie University) in which I carried out a meta-analysis of all studies that characterise the microbial communities that colonise plastics - the <strong>"Plastisphere"</strong>. I am interested in <strong>microbial community dynamics and interactions</strong>; how are these communities impacted by different factors of their environments? How do they change over time? What functions are they capable of carrying out?
