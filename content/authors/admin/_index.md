I'm Robyn Wright, and I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the Langille Lab (Department of Pharmacology, Dalhousie University) where I am investigating the human microbiome in healthy and diseased individuals. I recently completed an Association of Commonwealth Universities Blue Charter Fellowship (October 2019 - April 2020; School for Resources and Environmental Studies, Dalhousie University) in which I carried out a meta-analysis of all studies that characterise the microbial communities that colonise plastics - the "Plastisphere". I am interested in microbial community dynamics and interactions; how are these communities impacted by different factors of their environments? How do they change over time? What functions are they capable of carrying out?

On this site you can find my publications (with non-technical summaries), abstracts and slides for all conferences that I've presented at and my CV. </br>
Note that this site is currently a work in progress, but I hope to have everything up and running soon!
