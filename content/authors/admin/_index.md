Hello! My name is <em>Robyn Wright</em>, and I am currently a <em>postdoctoral research fellow in the Langille Lab</em> (Department of Pharmacology, Dalhousie University) and am researching the human microbiome in healthy and diseased individuals. I recently completed an Association of Commonwealth Universities <em>Blue Charter Fellowship</em> (October 2019-April 2020; School for Resources and Environmental Studies, Dalhousie University) in which I carried out a meta-analysis of all studies that characterise the microbial communities that colonise plastics - the "Plastisphere". I am interested in <em>microbial community dynamics and interactions</em>; how are these communities impacted by different factors of their environments? How do they change over time? What functions are they capable of carrying out?
