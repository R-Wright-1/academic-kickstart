<h2>PhD Biological Sciences: Food or just a free ride? Exploring marine microbial community dynamics on natural and synthetic polymers.</h2>
<strong>Supervisors</strong>: Dr. Joseph Christie-Oleza (School of Life Sciences, now University of the Balearic Islands, Spain) and Prof. Matthew Gibson (Department of Chemistry and Warwick Medical School)<br/>
<strong>Funding</strong>: Midlands Integrative Biosciences Training Partnership (MIBTP)
<br/> <br/>
<strong>Chapter 1 Understanding microbial community dynamics to improve optimal microbiome selection</strong>: Artificial selection of whole microbial communities was performed in order to increase the degradation rate of polymers in the marine environment, using chitin as a case study. The resulting microbial community changes and successional dynamics were characterized through MiSeq amplicon sequencing, allowing the optimization of this method.<br/>
<strong>Chapter 2 The PET Plastisphere: a multi-OMIC characterisation of marine PET-degrading isolates and analysis of microbial community succession</strong>: Microbial community succession was characterised across six weeks of incubation with different types of the common packaging plastic, PET, and, through MiSeq amplicon sequencing, identifying key players that are indicative of community successional stages and different treatments. The pathways used by two bacterial isolates for PET degradation were also elucidated through genomics, proteomics and metabolomics. <br/>
<strong>Chapter 3 Plasticizer degradation by marine bacterial isolates: a proteogenomic and metabolomic characterization</strong>: Characterization of the genomes, proteomes and metabolomes of two bacterial isolates was performed, allowing the identification of the mechanisms and enzymes used for the degradation of three plasticizers (plastic additives; dibutyl phthalate, bis(2-ethyl hexyl) phthalate and acetyl tributyl citrate). <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Additional projects</strong>:<br/>
<strong>Aging of bacteria in biofilms, using an individual-based model to study growth</strong>: This project expanded the previous work of the group, which used computational models (written in Java/Matlab) to study aging in bacteria, to models of bacteria growing/aging in biofilms. <em>Supervised by Dr. Jan-Ulrich Kreft, University of Birmingham, UK. Full time January to April 2016 and part time alongside other work until January 2020.</em>
