<h2>Summary</h2>
When plastics enter the oceans, they are rapidly colonised by a diverse community of microbes - termed the "Plastisphere". Research to date has not shown that different plastic types exert a strong effect on determining the composition of the Plastisphere, as would be expected if the colonising microbes were capable of degrading these plastics. When plastics enter the environment, they are usually acted upon by UV radiation, which starts the weathering process - if you have ever found that pieces of plastic on a beach are brittle, then this is because they have been weathered. In terms of the chemical structure of a plastic, the weathering breaks down the very long polymer chains into shorter chains that should be more accessible to bacteria. In this study, we wanted to find out: would any potential plastic degraders  colonise plastics in the ocean? Did these potential plastic degraders change in abundance over time? Was there a difference between the microbial communities that colonise weathered or non-weathered plastics and glass?</br></br>

In order to find this out, we incubated pieces of polyethylene (PE) plastics that were pre-weathered or non-weathered (as well as pieces of glass as a positive control) just off the coast of Mallorca (Spain) and characterised the microbial communities colonising these plastics after two and nine days of incubation. To characterise the bacteria in these communities, we sequenced the 16S rRNA gene (see my post on "Understanding microbial community dynamics to improve optimal microbiome selection" for further explanation of this).

We found that bacteria within the <em>Oleiphilus</em> genus - potential plastic degraders - made up almost 6 and 4% of the bacterial communities on weathered and non-weathered PE, respectively, on the second day of incubation (<em>vs</em> 0.6% on glass controls), but had decreased in abundance to below 0.3% on all materials by day nine (see below). We also found that there were several species of bacteria that showed a strong preference for the weathered PE during early colonisation stages (day two), for example members of the <em>Roseobacter</em> and <em>Aestuariibacter</em> groups (27 and 2% of the community, respectively), possibly because they are capable of growth using the short polymer chains generated from weathering.

Overall, our results demonstrate that the Plastisphere can vary according to the weathering state of the material and that early colonising communities are enriched with bacteria that can potentially degrade the plastics. </br></br>
