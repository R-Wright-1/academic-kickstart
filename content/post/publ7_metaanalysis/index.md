<h2>Summary</h2>
It is now indisputable that plastics are ubiquitous and problematic in ecosystems globally. Many suggestions have been made about the role that biofilms colonizing plastics in the environment – termed the “Plastisphere” – may play in the transportation and ecological impact of these plastics. By collecting and re-analyzing all raw 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metadata from 35 studies we have performed the first meta-analysis of the Plastisphere in marine, freshwater, other aquatic (e.g. brackish or aquaculture) and terrestrial environments. We show that random forest models can be trained to differentiate between groupings of environmental factors as well as aspects of study design, but – crucially – also between plastics when compared with control biofilms and between different plastic types and community successional stages. Our meta-analysis confirms that potentially biodegrading Plastisphere members, the hydrocarbonoclastic Oceanospirillales and Alteromonadales are consistently more abundant in plastic than control biofilm samples across multiple studies and environments. This indicates the predilection of these organisms for plastics and confirms the urgent need for their ability to biodegrade plastics to be comprehensively tested. We also identified key knowledge gaps that should be addressed by future studies. Gaps include a lack of knowledge on the Plastisphere in the Southern hemisphere and the necessity to move away from phylogeny-based inference of metabolic capacities and perform conclusive testing for pathogenicity and virulence factors as well as plastic biodegrading ability within the Plastisphere.</br></br>
