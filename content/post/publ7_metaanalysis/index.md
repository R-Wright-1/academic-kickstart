<h2>Summary</h2>
It is now indisputable that plastics are ubiquitous and problematic in ecosystems globally, from the Arctic to the Antarctic and everywhere in-between. Many suggestions have been made about the role that biofilms colonizing plastics in the environment – commonly termed the “Plastisphere” – may play in the transportation and ecological impact of these plastics, and the beginning of the 2020’s marked almost a decade of Plastisphere research. Microbial members of the Plastisphere have been suggested to be capable of biodegrading plastics (or their toxic additives), carrying pathogenic organisms across ocean basins and facilitating the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. Currently, the different bioinformatic analyses employed by the ~50 Plastisphere studies means that they are not directly comparable, and it has therefore not previously been possible to draw large-scale conclusions on the factors driving the assembly and functioning of the Plastisphere. We performed a meta-analysis where we collected and re-analyzed all of the raw sequencing and metadata from these studies and were therefore able to thoroughly characterize the global Plastisphere in marine, aquatic, freshwater and terrestrial environments for the first time.</br></br>


I will post a full summary of this paper when it has been peer reviewed and published.
