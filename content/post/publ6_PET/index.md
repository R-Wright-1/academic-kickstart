<h2>Summary</h2>
Recalcitrant polymers are widely distributed in the environment. This includes natural polymers, such as chitin, but also synthetic polymers, which are becoming increasingly abundant, and for which biodegradation is uncertain. Distribution of labour in microbial communities commonly evolves in nature, particularly for arduous processes, suggesting that a community may be better at degrading recalcitrant compounds than individual microorganisms. However, microbial communities typically go through distinct stages of community succession and efficient degraders are quickly replaced with cheaters and cross-feeders. Here we aimed to determine whether i) a marine microbial community may be capable of degrading the common packaging plastic poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and whether we see microbial community succession on PET, ii) whether we can determine the pathways used for PET degradation by marine microbial isolates, and iii) if the community may be better able to degrade PET than the isolates. We incubated several different types of PET with the natural microbial community found colonising coastal marine debris, and characterised the microbial community succession across the incubation period. We show an enrichment of taxa that have previously been shown to be capable of the degradation of recalcitrant compounds, although the differences between communities growing with different substrates are most distinct at early successional stages. We were also able to identify that a microbial isolate, <em>Thioclava</em> sp. BHET1, uses a similar pathway for PET degradation as other terrestrial bacteria, and that a second microbial isolate, <em>Bacillus</em> sp. BHET2, may use a novel pathway for PET degradation. Results from FTIR analyses of PET incubated with both the microbial community and the isolates suggested that the both the community and the isolates could degrade PET, but there were more significant differences between the plastics incubated with the community and the control than either of the isolates and the control.</br></br>
