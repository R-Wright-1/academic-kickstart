<h2>Submitted abstract</h2></br>
Recalcitrant polymers are widely distributed in the environment. This includes natural polymers, such as chitin, but synthetic polymers are becoming increasingly abundant, for which biodegradation is uncertain. Distribution of labour in microbial communities commonly evolves in nature, particularly for arduous processes, suggesting a community may be better at degrading recalcitrant compounds than individual microorganisms. Artificial selection of microbial communities with better degradation potential has seduced scientists for over a decade, but the method has not been systematically optimised nor applied to polymer degradation. Using chitin as a case study, we successfully selected for microbial communities with enhanced chitinase activities but found that continuous optimisation of incubation times between selective generations was of utmost importance. The analysis of the community composition over the entire selection process revealed fundamental aspects in microbial ecology: when incubation times between generations were optimal, the system was dominated by Gammaproteobacteria, main bearers of chitinase enzymes and drivers of chitin degradation, before being succeeded by cheating, cross-feeding and grazing organisms.
