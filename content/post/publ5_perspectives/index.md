<h2>Summary</h2>
Plastics become rapidly colonized by microbes when released into marine environments. This microbial community - known as the Plastisphere - is made up of bacteria, single-celled algae and fungi (as well as the larvae of macro-organisms) and is at the interface between the plastics and their surrounding environment. The Plastisphere is the focus of more than 60 studies so we reviewed the findings of these studies (as well as the methods used) in order to draw conclusions on what we know about the Plastisphere. We also identified key areas for future research to be focused.</br></br>

We searched for all studies that mention the Plastisphere, the microbial community on plastics or microbial degradation of plastics in the marine environment, which gave us 66 studies (see below - this list was current in December 2019 when we started writing, but there are lots more now!). We summarised whether the studies: (i) were carried out in a lab or in the field; (ii) collected plastics that were already in the environment or looked at plastics that they'd put there themselves; (iii) characterised the microbial community using DNA sequencing or microscopy; (iv) used a control of another surface (biofilm; such as glass or wood), looked at the planktonic community in the surrounding water or at the community associated with very small particles in the water; (v) looked at potential pathogens or genes for antimicrobial resistance; and (vi) looked at plastic biodegradation.

We then used this to take a detailed look at the following questions:</br>

<b>Is the Plastisphere actually distinct from the microbial community (biofilm) that forms on any other surface in the environment?</b></br>
All current research suggests that the answer to this is "yes", but: (i) the strongest differences between materials occur at the very early stages of colonisation (and are strongly influenced by the availability of other chemicals on the plastics); (ii) environmental variables (such as temperature or salinity) have a larger influence on the community than plastic/surface type) and (iii) differences between materials are usually driven by rare members of the community. </br>

<b>What "feeds" and shapes the Plastisphere?</b></br>
As with all life, the Plastisphere needs: 
<li><I>Water:</I> water is obviously not in short supply in the oceans (although it may be when plastics are washed up on the beach), but we don't yet know the effect on microbial communities when they move from rivers out to sea</li>
<li><I>Nutrients:</I> our preliminary evidence shows that plastics likely concentrate nutrients from the surrounding water, making them more accessible to microbial communities (or organisms that might eat the plastics, intentionally or not)</li>
<li><I>Energy:</I> on buoyant plastics in the surface waters of the ocean (photic zones), the Plastisphere likely gains its energy from photosynthesis, but other plastics sink to deeper layers that don't have enough light (aphotic zones) for photosynthesis. This might force the Plastisphere to get energy from degrading: (i) compounds from its surrounding environment; (ii) the biofilm itself; or (iii) the plastics or plastic additives.

<b>How does the Plastisphere change over time?</b></br>
Most (if not all) biofilms go through distinct stages of succession (see [my first paper](https://r-wright-1.github.io/post/publ1_chi_selec/) for a more in-depth view of this!): (i) initial colonisation of the surface (usually by any microbes that are capable of attaching to the surface); (ii) selection for organisms that can degrade the surface; and (iii) succession, where the degraders are overtaken by "cheaters" and cross-feeders (organisms that can't degrade the surface themselves, but can use the products of this degradation and benefit from those that do). When these stages occur will depend on a range of factors (temperature, light, nutrient availability, etc), but it appears that potential plastic biodegraders are abundant after just a few days and by just over one week these have been overtaken by other microbes.

<b>Could the Plastisphere explain the unaccounted fraction of plastics?</b></br>
Numerous marine surveys have pointed at a ['missing 99%'](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/ninety-nine-percent-ocean-plastic-has-gone-missing#:~:text=Every%20year%2C%20we%20dump%208,the%20Great%20Pacific%20Garbage%20Patch.) of plastics - a large disparity between the quantity of plastic predicted to have entered the environment and the amount found by monitoring studies. We had a quick look at calculating how much a buoyant plastic needs to be colonised before it would sink from the ocean surface, but we need more information before we can say whether the Plastisphere could 'drag' these plastics down to the deep sea or whether they might oscillate, as we show in the figure above.</br>

<b>Do plastics select for biodegrading organisms in the environment?</b> (Or are there biodegrading organisms present within the Plastisphere?)</br>
Lots of studies have suggested that there are microbes in the Plastisphere that are capable of plastic degradation, but so far this hasn't been proven by anyone. To be able to answer this question, we need to focus research on: (i) using methods that actually *prove* biodegradation (for example, some studies measure weight loss of the plastics, but it isn't clear whether the plastics are actually being degraded or are just being broken up into smaller pieces); and (ii) determining the mechanisms behind plastic biodegradation for all plastics (which enzymes are used and which organisms possess these enzymes?)</br>

<b>What effect does the Plastisphere have on the availability of plastic-bound chemicals?</b></br>
Plastics themselves are generally inert, but they are often associated with various chemicals that can be toxic - additives (those that are intentionally added during manufacturing) and contaminants (those that 'stick' to the plastics once in the environment) (see my [previous paper](https://r-wright-1.github.io/post/publ3_plasticizer/) for more on this!). Many of these chemicals are degraded by microbes, so does the Plastisphere reduce the toxicity of plastics? We need more information on this, but we hypothesise that plastics might act as hotspots of toxic chemical degradation.</br>

<b>Do plastics disperse pathogens? Is it only plastics that do this?</b></br>
Several previous Plastisphere studies have reported that potentially pathogenic microbes are present on marine plastics. These often focus on the *Vibrio* spp. bacteria, which are responsible for cholera (*Vibrio cholerae*) and shellfish poisoning (*Vibrio vulnificus*), but harmless *Vibrio* species are also present in the water column and in some cases form beneficial relationships with some animals (like the [bioluminescent *Vibrio fischeri*, a symbiont of the Hawaiian bobtail squid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliivibrio_fischeri)). We ask three main questions here: (i) Are these *potential* pathogens indeed pathogenic? (ii) Do pathogens accumulate on plastics and are there plastic-specific pathogens? (iii) Do plastics act as vectors for pathogen dispersal? The methods currently used don't allow us to differentiate between closely related pathogenic and non-pathogenic species, and - even if we assume that these potential pathogens are indeed pathogenic - there is not currently enough evidence to suggest that they are more abundant on plastics than on other materials (and may even be less abundant).</br>

<b>What influence does the Plastisphere have on marine food webs?</b></br>
We are advocating for more studies to examine plastic-biofilm-environment interactions, rather than simply plastic-environment interactions. Some studies have shown plastic 'flavouring' - plastics exposed to seawater pick up chemicals that are used by foraging animals, and plastic ingestion is higher in animals that use these chemical cues than in those that don't. Plastics with microbial biofilms also accumulate considerable amounts of nutrients, which might lead to different results in plastic ingestion studies than with pristine plastics (that are also not environmentally relevant). </br>

<b>Conclusions</b></br>
We conclude that research so far has not demonstrated that Plastisphere communities differ starkly from other microbiofilms and - while plastics are pollutants to the environment - we caution against overstatements and the use of unrealistic concentrations and conditions to prove negative effects. We also suggest that the most important areas for future study are:</br>
<li><b><I>A thorough characterisation of Plastisphere biofilms</b></I> - if we know the thickness, weight and density then this will help to make accurate predictions on the fate of plastics in the ocean</li>
<li><b><I>Inclusion of relevant controls</b></I> - to have a reliable indication of how different the communities on plastics really are from the communities on <I>e.g.</I> glass or wood</li>
<li><b><I>Evaluate different Plastisphere successional stages</b></I></li>
<li><b><I>Look at the Plastisphere at different depths</b></I></li>
<li><b><I>Use biofouled plastics for ecotoxicology experiments</b></I> (to better approximate natural conditions)</li>
<li><b><I>Use environmentally relevant concentrations of plastics in studies</b></I> (frequently plastics studies use far higher concentrations of plastics than are actually found, so - in most cases - we don't know whether the concentration of plastics that is actually <I>in the environment</I> has any negative effects on wildlife or humans)</li>
<li><b><I>Prioritise the identification of mechanisms for the biodegradation of plastics and whether potential pathogens are really pathogenic</b></I></li>
