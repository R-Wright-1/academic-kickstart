<h2>Submitted abstract</h2></br>
Approximately 8 million tons of plastics (synthetic polymers) are thought to enter the oceans every year, and this figure is increasing. Plastics in the marine environment are notoriously difficult to degrade and may therefore persist indefinitely. In order to learn about the likely fate of these synthetic polymers in the ocean, we may be able to look at the fate of natural marine polymers, which are already degraded by marine microorganisms. When compared with single strains, microbial communities and consortia have previously been found to degrade environmental contaminants more efficiently, and artificial selection of whole ecosystems has been used to evolve communities of microorganisms that are better able to degrade contaminants than their original counterparts. Here, we present a method in which a microbial community, that was taken from colonised coastal marine debris, may be artificially selected to be better able to degrade polymers, using chitin, an abundant but recalcitrant natural polymer, as proof of concept. We found that, not only could a community be selected and evolved to have higher chitinase activity, and therefore potential to degrade chitin than the original environmental community, but MiSeq amplicon sequencing showed there to be an enrichment of groups that have been previously shown to be capable of degrading chitin. It was found that an important methodological caveat was that regular testing for the optimal incubation time of communities should be carried out, so as the next generation may be taken at the time of the peak in chitinase activity. This is because of microbial community succession; after an initial peak in community members that are able to produce chitinases, these are overtaken by “cheaters”. The results of this study indicate the potential of microorganisms to develop the ability to better degrade more recalcitrant marine polymers.
