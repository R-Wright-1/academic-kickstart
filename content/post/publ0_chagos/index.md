<h2>Summary</h2></br>
This study collected and analysed a number of samples taken from the Chagos Archipelago (British Indian Ocean Territory) in order to determine the levels of a range of pollutants in this uninhabited Pacific Ocean Archipelago. I was involved with analysing sand samples sent from inhabited and uninhabited areas for their concentrations of Microplastics. We separated the Microplastics from the sand using density separation (the plastics float in hyper saline water, while the sand sinks) and then identified the plastic types using Fourier transform-Infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopy. We found particles at all 20 sites, and these included a range of plastic types, such as nylon, polyethylene, polyester, polypropylene and rayon and the abundance of these particles (approximately 5 per 50 ml sand) was among the highest reported worldwide at that time.
