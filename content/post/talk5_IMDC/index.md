<h2>Submitted abstract</h2></br>
Up to 12.7 million tons of plastics (recalcitrant synthetic polymers) are thought to enter the oceans every year, and this figure is likely to increase. Plastics in the marine environment are notoriously difficult to degrade and may therefore persist for hundreds of years. In order to learn about the likely fate of these synthetic polymers in the ocean, we may be able to look at the fate of natural marine polymers, which are already degraded by marine bacteria. When compared with single strains, microbial communities and consortia have previously been found to degrade environmental contaminants more efficiently, and artificial selection of whole ecosystems has been used to evolve communities of microorganisms that are better able to degrade these contaminants than their original counterparts. Here, we present a method in which a microbial community, that was taken from colonised coastal marine debris, may be artificially selected to be better able to degrade polymers, using chitin, an abundant but recalcitrant natural polymer, as proof of concept. We found that, not only could a community, be selected and evolved to have higher chitinase activity, and therefore potential to degrade chitin than the original environmental community, but that it also possessed a higher diversity of chitinases than an individual strain, and may therefore be able to degrade chitin more completely and efficiently. Currently, this method is being applied to the degradation of the commonly used packaging plastic poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET). Here, the determination of the best community is based upon the ability to grow using PET as the sole carbon source, and uses a combination of metabolic and enzyme activity assays, clear zone plates and changes in the composition and weight of PET films exposed to these communities to assess this. We hope that the results of this study will indicate the potential of microorganisms to develop the ability to degrade marine plastics.
