<h2>Submitted abstract</h2></br>
<strong>Can artificial community selection aid in the degradation of marine polymers?</strong></br>
Up to 12.7 million tons of plastics are thought to enter the oceans every year. Plastics are notoriously difficult to degrade in the marine environment and are therefore expected to persist for hundreds of years, however, some previous studies have found microorganisms that are capable of the biodegradation of plastics. Research has shown that a microbial community or consortia may be able to degrade environmental contaminants more efficiently than single strains, and this study aimed to determine whether a microbial community may be evolved, using artificial selection, that is better able to degrade polymers than the initial environmental community. A proof of principle artificial selection has been carried out to evolve a community for the degradation of chitin, a recalcitrant natural polymer that plays an important role in ocean nutrient cycling, that we know marine microorganisms are capable of degrading. This involved selecting the best communities based on high chitinase activity (degradation potential) and used these to inoculate the next generation. 16S and 18S MiSeq amplicon sequencing is currently being carried out to determine the nature of any changes in microbial community composition, as well as to look at community succession within the incubation period of a generation.
