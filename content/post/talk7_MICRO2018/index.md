<h2>Submitted abstract</h2></br>
Up to 12.7 million tons of plastics are thought to enter the oceans every year, and this figure is likely to increase. As recalcitrant synthetic polymers, plastics are notoriously difficult to degrade in the marine environment and are therefore expected to persist indefinitely. To learn about the likely fate of these synthetic polymers in the ocean, we can investigate the fate of recalcitrant natural marine polymers, which are biodegraded by marine bacteria. Through artificial selection of a whole microbial community, we have obtained a microbial community that degrades the natural, recalcitrant polymer, chitin, more efficiently than that which naturally occurs. We found that the evolved community exhibited higher chitinase activity, and therefore higher potential to degrade chitin. We characterised the community using MiSeq and by obtaining isolates and found that it became enriched in organisms that are able to degrade chitin, but only when important methodological caveats, relating to the incubation time between selections, were met. We are currently applying the same method to explore the degradability of the commonly used packaging plastic poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET). Here, the community that is best at degradation is determined based upon its ability to grow with PET as the sole carbon source. We have carried out a community succession experiment prior to the selection experiment using a range of different types of PET (i.e. PET, weathered PET, low-crystallinity PET, PET monomer) and will carry this out again at the end of the selection. The community succession here is assessed using metabolic activity assays, amplicon sequencing of the community and chemical monitoring for PET degradation products. The results of this study will inform us on the potential for microbial communities to develop the ability to degrade marine plastics.
